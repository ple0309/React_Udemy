## ⚛️ React Learning Track (Udemy)

In parallel with my JavaScript and full-stack studies, I am also learning **React**
to build modern, component-based user interfaces and fullstack web applications.

This learning track focuses on understanding **React fundamentals first**,
then gradually moving toward more advanced topics such as state management,
routing, and fullstack integration.
